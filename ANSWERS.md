- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
   Class components offers more react life cycle methods than functional components and it is legacy code, and most of the code is written using class components.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
      componentDidMount --> Once all the component are mounted on DOM, this life cycle methods is ready to work.
      componentDidUpdate --> As soon as changes in state are made this life cycle method kicks in.
      componentWillunMount --> This can be used to clear any memory leaks in the application.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      customs can be used thoughout the application. So write once, use many a time.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      Bug free code, works as a documentation for your application, debgging becomes easy, and provides more in-depth analysis of the code.
  Ans:- In order to main the application data which is handled by state and get the benefit of using life cycle methods in the application, we use class components over function components.
- [ ] Name three life cycle methods and their purposes.
  Ans:- componentDidMount - once the components are mounted on the DOM, we use this life cycle method to make get the data like making API calls.
        componentDidUpdate - To render component only if the state or props are updated.
        componentWillUnMount - To avoid any memory leaks.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
     Implementing DRY, writing once - use several times.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    To avoid bugs in the code, works as a documentation for the application.
