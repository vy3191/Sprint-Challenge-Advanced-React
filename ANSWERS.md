- [ ] Name three life cycle methods and their purposes.
  Ans:- componentDidMount - once the components are mounted on the DOM, we use this life cycle method to make get the data like making API calls.
        componentDidUpdate - To render component only if the state or props are updated.

     Implementing DRY, writing once - use several times.

    To avoid bugs in the code, works as a documentation for the application.
